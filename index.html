            <h2>Johan Juarez</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Johan Juarez. I'm a TXTer and doing other extracurricular activities for the summer that I am gonna work on . I have a passion for music and video games. I want to rejoin this to program to improve on what i did last year. im a expert and will be learning to lead the L.I.L.s </p>
            
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            
            <p>The Lightbulb Challegne was very easy, since i have the experience compared to last year where i didn't know what i was doing. I guess the hard part of the challenge was finding the right lightbulb because i wanted everything to be perfect for my project.</p>

            <p>The Prompt Engineering Challenge was easier because I already know this challenge from long ago in the SEALs class, this challenge was not hard, but it was time consuming, especially when i was making many projects for each different catergory of a prompt.</p>
